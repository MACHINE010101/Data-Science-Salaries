    "[Data modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling) is a crucial process in information management that involves the creation of a conceptual, logical, and physical representation of data. It provides a structured approach for organizing and storing data in a database, enabling efficient access and retrieval of information. Effective data modeling ensures the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of data by establishing clear relationships between data elements and defining their attributes.\n",

    "In this report, I will provide an overview of data modeling, including its importance, process, and techniques used in developing a data model. I will then demonstrate the application of data modeling by using a dataset that the teacher sent from kaggle. Additionally, I will explain the steps involved in the data modeling process. This is to cover modeling aspects that I can still imporve on."
